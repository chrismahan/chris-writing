## Money ##

Finance, money,  
By the billions  
Printed, traded  
All man's labor,  
Tabulated.

## Bombed ##

They looked at me and said  
He's not gonna make it.  
I could not feel my legs  
My left arm was missing  
My head was still swimming  
And I was still reeling  
From the bomb in the street  
That blew my dreams away.  
Tell them that I love them  
I wish I could kiss them  
And hold them in my arms  
If you know what I mean.  
I'll stare at the blue sky  
While the world fades away  
To numb then to silence  
And at last all to dark.
